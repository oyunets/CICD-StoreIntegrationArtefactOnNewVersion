WHAT IS CPILINT?

CPILint is a command-line tool for SAP Cloud Integration, that lets you automate
the governance of your integration flows. With CPILint, you create executable
development guidelines, by setting up a number of rules, that you want your
integration flows to comply with.

The tool ships with a number of built-in rules, that enable you to, for
instance, disallow the use of certain adapters, check that only your
organizationâ€™s sanctioned mapping tools and scripting languages are being used,
and ensure that security best practices are being followed.

With your chosen rules in place, CPILint does the heavy lifting of checking that
your integration flows are compliant, and presenting you with a report of those
that are not.
